## Gmail SMTP Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication

1. Go to [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable "2-Step Verification" if not already enabled

### Step 2: Generate App Password

1. Visit [Google App Passwords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
2. Sign in to your Google account
3. Select "Mail" as the app
4. Select "Other (Custom name)" as the device
5. Enter "Web3SSH 2025" as the custom name
6. Click "Generate"
7. Copy the 16-character app password (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

### Step 3: Update Environment Variables

Update the `.env.local` file:

```bash
MAIL_EMAIL=aadipatel1911@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop  # Replace with the 16-character app password (no spaces)
```

### Step 4: Test Email Service

Run the test script to verify email functionality:

```bash
node test-email.cjs
```

You should see:

```
‚úÖ Email service connection verified!
‚úÖ Test email sent successfully!
```

## Alternative Email Providers

If Gmail continues to have issues, you can use other email providers:

### SendGrid (Recommended for Production)

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
  host: 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
  port: 587,
  auth: {
    user: 'apikey',
    pass: process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY,
  },
});
```

### Outlook/Hotmail

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  service: 'hotmail',
  auth: {
    user: process.env.MAIL_EMAIL,
    pass: process.env.MAIL_PASSWORD,
  },
});
```

## Testing the Complete Flow

### 1. Test Project Submission (without email)

The project submission API will work even if email fails:

1. Navigate to the hackathon dashboard
2. Submit a test project
3. Verify the submission is successful
4. Check console logs for email status

### 2. Test Email Service Separately

Use the provided test script:

```bash
node test-email.cjs
```

### 3. Test Complete Integration

Once email credentials are fixed:

1. Submit a project through the dashboard
2. Check the participant's email inbox
3. Verify the confirmation email was received

## Email Template Preview

The confirmation email includes:

- üéâ **Success Badge** with Web3SSH 2025 branding
- üìã **Project Details** with all submission information
- üÜî **Submission ID** for tracking
- üöÄ **Next Steps** with timeline and instructions
- üìû **Contact Information** and social links

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Authentication Failed**: Use App Password instead of regular password
2. **Timeout Error**: Check internet connection and Gmail service status
3. **Rate Limiting**: Gmail has daily sending limits for regular accounts
4. **Spam Folder**: Check participant's spam folder for emails

### Production Recommendations:

1. Use a dedicated email service like SendGrid or AWS SES for high volume
2. Implement email queuing for better reliability
3. Add email delivery status tracking
4. Set up monitoring for email failures
